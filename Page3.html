    <h1><u style="color: brown;">How to Store ChocolateThe Dos and Don'ts:</u></h1>
    <p>Cacao Magazine October 23, 2020. If you live in a hot climate or it's currently summer,
     having your chocolate melt or bloom can be a frustrating experience.
      Your first instinct is probably to put it in the fridge, but we're here to say don't do it 
      for your own sake! Keeping your chocolate fresh is fairly simple, if you know how.
       Below we'll show you the tips and tricks on how to store chocolate.<br>
       <ul>
        <li><h5> Don't keep your chocolate in the fridge
            Although you might be tempted, resist any urges to keep your chocolate in the fridge!
            <span style="color: chocolate;">Here are two reasons why:</span></h5></li></ul>

            <ol><li>Chocolate will absorb the aromas of the fridge. The cocoa butter in chocolate is great at 
                soaking up any nearby odours. So if you've got cheese, fish, onions or 
                really any other food items in your fridge, the smells will transfer. The result will be that
                your chocolate will taste of those other items in the tridge and lose its original
                aroma.</li><br>

                <li> Chocolate is sensitive to temperature fluctuations. Exposing the chocolate to warm temperatures
              after it has been refrigerated will cause sugar bloom. Why? Because the sugar in chocolate will be attracted
               to the moisture that collects onthe bar as it's warming up. This causes the sugar to rise to the top of the bar and dissolve.
                As the moisture evaporates the sugar crystals are left at the top. This is why your chocolate will have a white,
                 dusty appearance. Sugar bloom affects both the texture and taste of the chocolate.
                </li>
            </ol>
            
                <ul><li><h5>Do store it in a cool, dry place:</h5></li></ul>
                <ol><li> Perfect place to store your chocolate is in a dry, cool, and dark place. Ideally,
                  the temperature should be consistently around 15째C to 18째C (59째F - 64째F). The relative humidity needs to be below 55%.
                If kept in these conditions, the state of chocolate can stay unchanged for months,
                sometimes even years. An ideal place for keeping chocolate is in an odourless tin or box within the pantry.</li></ol>

                <ul><li><h5> keep it in an air-tight container:</h></li></ul>
            <ol><li>Keep your chocolate in an air-tight container to it from odours or moisture. Remember, the
                cocoa butter in chocolate takes on the aromas of nearby objects. That's why it's a bad idea to keep your chocolate where you keep your coffee.
                Some chocolate bars come in resealable
                packaging. If it doesn't, then we recommend using a ziplock bag to keep the chocolate fresh.</li></ol>

                <ul><li><h5> Don't keep it lying around in the light:</h5></li></ul>
                <ol><li>When chocolate comes into contact with light and air, it undergoes a process known as oxidation.
                     The oxidation of chocolate will cause it to bloom and impact the flavour and texture of the bar.<br>
                    Keeping chocolate in the light may also cause it to heat up and melt. This in turn will alter the 
                    chemical structure of your chocolate and cause it to bloom.</li></ol>
